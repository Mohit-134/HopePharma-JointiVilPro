<strong>1. Order Processing & Shipping</strong>

All orders are processed immediately upon confirmation to ensure fast and efficient dispatch from our fulfillment warehouse.
Orders are shipped via trusted international couriers. Shipping fees paid at checkout cover the cost of delivery from our warehouse to the destination country.

<strong>2. Customs Duties & Local Charges</strong>

Customs duties, VAT, courier disbursement fees, or other local charges are not included in the purchase price or shipping fee.
These charges are set by your country's customs regulations and are the responsibility of the recipient.
Refusing to pay customs or local fees may result in the package being delayed, returned, or destroyed. In such cases, we are not liable for refunds or replacements.

<strong>3. Cancellation, Return & Refund Policy</strong>

We do not accept cancellations, changes, or returns after the time of purchase.
This policy helps protect product integrity, prevent inventory disruptions, and safeguard against fraud. It is clearly outlined for full transparency and fairness.
In rare cases, if a customer has a serious concern regarding their order, we may consider offering a partial refund, depending on the situation. This is done on a case-by-case basis and only as a goodwill gesture — not an obligation.

<strong>4. Pricing & Promotional Transparency</strong>

We clearly display all promotional offers and include the equivalent "same as" price per item to ensure full pricing transparency.
All prices are final at the time of purchase and reflect our current promotions and shipping terms.

<strong>5. Delivery Responsibility</strong>

Our responsibility is fulfilled once the product has been shipped and valid tracking is provided.
Delays, failed deliveries, or local rejections due to unpaid customs or courier issues are the responsibility of the customer.
We encourage all customers to follow up with their local courier office if issues arise during customs clearance or final delivery.

<strong>6. Need Help?</strong>

We’re here to assist you at every step. Please contact our customer service team if you need help tracking your order or understanding local delivery procedures.`;
